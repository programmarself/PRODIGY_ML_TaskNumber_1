### Task 1 
# House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques
#### Introduction
Predicting the selling price of a home is an important topic in real estate. There are several elements that influence the price of a home. Some factors may produce an increase in price, others may cause a fall, and yet others are reliant on one or more factors, i.e. their combination with other factors determines whether they will increase or decrease the price. To assist us in determining the relationship between these attributes and sale prices, we have data from 1460 residences (sold). The dataset covers nearly all of the elements that influence a house's sales price, including overall quality, neighborhood, the presence of a basement and/or garage, and so on, in addition to the sale price. The aim is to, perform exploratory data analysis for finding out which factors affect the most. We will be using of multiple machine learning algorithms and choose the one which has the highest accuracy. Then training, evaluating and tuning the model with appropriate parameter values, we will try to keep the RMSE minimum. I will also create a web application having user frinedly interfece where one can easily get the sale price of their house just by giving the different attributes of the house as an input.

### Task 2  
# Mall Customer Segmentation Data

## Market Basket Analysis

### About Dataset

**Context**
This dataset is created solely for the purpose of learning customer segmentation concepts, also known as market basket analysis. It will be demonstrated using an unsupervised machine learning technique (KMeans Clustering Algorithm) in its simplest form.

**Content**
If you own a supermarket mall and have access to membership cards, you might have some basic data about your customers such as Customer ID, age, gender, annual income, and spending score. The spending score is assigned to the customer based on defined parameters like customer behavior and purchasing data.

### Problem Statement

You own the mall and want to understand the customersâ€”specifically, those who can be easily converged [Target Customers]â€”so that marketing strategies can be devised accordingly.
